        <p>CSS <em>(Cascading Style Sheets)</em> is the code that styles web content. It is a style sheet language that
            is used to selectively style HTML elements. While CSS is great for creating text styles, it is helpful for formatting other aspects of Web page layout as well. For example, CSS can be used to define the cell padding of table cells, the style, thickness, and color of a table's border, and the padding around images or other objects. CSS gives Web developers more exact control over how Web pages will look than HTML does. 
            This is why most Web pages today incorporate cascading style sheets.

        <h2 class="underline">Anatomy of a CSS ruleset</h2>
        <p>Let's dissect the CSS code for red paragraph text to understand how it works :
        <img src=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics/css-declaration-small.png width="60%" height="180">
         <br/>
         <br/>
            The whole structure is called a ruleset. <em>(The term ruleset is often referred to as just rule.)</em> Note the names of the individual parts:

        <ol>
            <li> <strong>Selector:</strong> This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines the element(s) to be styled (in this example, < p> elements).To style a different element, change the selector.</li>
            <li> <strong>Declaration:</strong> This is a single rule like color: red;. It specifies which of the element's properties you want to style</li>
            <li> <strong>Properties:</strong>These are ways in which you can style an HTML element. (In this example, color is a property of the < p >  elements.) In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in the rule.</li>
            <li> <strong>Property value:</strong>To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the property value. This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property. 
                (For example, there are many color values in addition to red.)</li>
        </ol>
        Note the other important parts of the syntax:
        <ul>
            <li>Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces. ({}) </li>
             <li>Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the property from its value or values.</li>   
             <li>Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (;) to separate each declaration from the next one.</li>   
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2 class="underline">Different types of selectors</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Element selector <em>(sometimes called a tag or type selector)</em></li>
    <li>ID selector</li>
    <li>Class selector</li>
    <li>Attribute selector</li>
    <li>Pseudo-class selector</li>
    </ul>

    There are many more selectors to discover. To learn more, see the MDN <a target="_blank" href= "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors">Selectors guide.</a>
